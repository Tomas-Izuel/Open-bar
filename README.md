### What is OpenBar?

Open Bar is the app designed specifically for bars to sell their products more efficiently! With Open Bar, bar owners can easily manage their inventory and track their sales in real-time. Our user-friendly interface allows bar owners to quickly add and update their menu items, view their profits, and process orders all in one place.
